          <span>Christopher Emmanuel Paul</span> (born May 6, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the 
      National Basketball Association (NBA). He has won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, 
      two Olympic gold medals, and led the NBA in assists four times and steals six times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul was a McDonald's All-American in high school. He attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, 
      where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number one ranking. He was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft 
      by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's premier players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player 
      Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, only for the transaction to be controversiall 
      voided by the NBA. Later that summer, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers instead. Behind Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed 
        a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname "Lob City". In 2017, he was traded 
      to the Houston Rockets, and helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season.
      Off the court, Paul has served as the National Basketball Players Association president since August 2013. 
      Paul is a Christian and attends church every Sunday whenever possible. In one interview, Paul commented, "I am so thankful that my 
      parents raised me and C.J. to depend on God's guidance and our faith in Him, and to always be thankful for what we receive." He  
      enjoys bowling and owns a franchise in the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) League called L.A.X.

        <p>
          <span>Maroon 5</span> is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.
          It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, 
          bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton, and 
          multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick 
          first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their 
          independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. 
          The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2001, the band remerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine.
          The band signed with Octone Records, a subsidiary of J Records, and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. 
          Aided by its lead single "Harder to Breathe", which received heavy airplay, the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart,
          and went platinum in 2004. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering 
          from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.

          <span>Christopher Emmanuel Paul</span> (born May 6, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the 
      National Basketball Association (NBA). He has won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, 
      two Olympic gold medals, and led the NBA in assists four times and steals six times.

          Paul was a McDonald's All-American in high school. He attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, 
      where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number one ranking. He was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft 
      by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's premier players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player 
      Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, only for the transaction to be controversiall 
      voided by the NBA. Later that summer, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers instead. Behind Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed 
        a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname "Lob City". In 2017, he was traded 
      to the Houston Rockets, and helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season.
      Off the court, Paul has served as the National Basketball Players Association president since August 2013. 
      Paul is a Christian and attends church every Sunday whenever possible. In one interview, Paul commented, "I am so thankful that my 
      parents raised me and C.J. to depend on God's guidance and our faith in Him, and to always be thankful for what we receive." He  
      enjoys bowling and owns a franchise in the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) League called L.A.X.

          <span>Tracy McGrady</span> (McGrady entered the NBA straight out of high school and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1997 NBA 
      draft. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with 
      his cousin Vince Carter. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the Orlando Magic, where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers 
      and a candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. In 2004, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, 
        where he paired with center Yao Ming to help the Rockets become a perennial playoff team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries,  
      and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the San Antonio Spurs. 
      Since retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for ESPN. From April–July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional 
      baseball, pitching for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

        <p>
          <span>Yao Ming</span> (Chinese: 姚明; born September 12, 1980) is a Chinese basketball executive and retired professional basketball player who played 
      for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
      He was selected to start for the Western Conference in the NBA All-Star Game eight times, and was named to the All-NBA Team five times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yao, who was born in Shanghai, started playing for the Shanghai Sharks as a teenager, and played on their senior team for 
        five years in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), winning a championship in his final year. After negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks 
        to secure his release, Yao was selected by the Houston Rockets as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He reached the NBA Playoffs four 
        times, and the Rockets won the first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced 
        his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons.
        In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.
        Yao is one of China's best-known athletes, with sponsorships with several major companies. His rookie year in the NBA was the subject of a 
        documentary film, The Year of the Yao, and he co-wrote, along with NBA analyst Ric Bucher, an autobiography titled Yao: A Life in Two Worlds.
        In April 2016, Yao was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, alongside Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson.
        In February 2017, Yao was unanimously elected as chairman of Chinese Basketball Association.

        <p>
          <span>Maroon 5</span> is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.
          It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, 
          bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton, and 
          multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick 
          first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their 
          independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. 
          The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2001, the band remerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine.
          The band signed with Octone Records, a subsidiary of J Records, and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. 
          Aided by its lead single "Harder to Breathe", which received heavy airplay, the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart,
          and went platinum in 2004. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering 
          from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.
